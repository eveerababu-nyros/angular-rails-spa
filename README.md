<h3>Rails + AngularJS </h3>

Check demo app <a href="http://rails-angular-spa.herokuapp.com">here</a>.

 Here I have used User module and Exam module.
 
   <p>In User module I have provided all CRUD operations in a single page, created a custom directive called modalDialog to enable modal box effect.</p>

  </p>In Exam module I have provided 10 questions with options and right side you can see results of activiy.</p>
  <p>When you want nested form to using AngularJS, you need to write your own code. In this app I given sample code for nested form.</p>

<h3>Thanks</h3>
